# OpenInSteamOverlay

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that makes links open in the steam overlay instead of your default browser. 

This implements the option requested on https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/241

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [OpenInSteamOverlay.dll](https://github.com/XDelta/ResoniteOpenInSteamOverlay/releases/latest/download/OpenInSteamOverlay.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
